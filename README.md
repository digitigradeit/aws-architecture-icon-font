# aws-architecture-icon-font

Icon font for the [AWS architecture icons](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/).

Using an icon font could be useful for numerous applications: documentation, resume/cv/skillset sections, portfolio or blogs where embedding/inserting lots of tiny SVG files each with HTML tags and/or CSS could be rather tedious and time-consuming.

This is similar to how FontAwesome, Material Icons, Bootstrap Icons, etc. all work.
